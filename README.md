A tool that allows you to copy emojis by just one click; it also has a textarea that allows typing and previewing the looks along with the emojis copied into. Supports Twemoji and skin tone switching.

A cron job is written to periodically parse the [latest set of Unicode emojis](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-test.txt) and cached.
